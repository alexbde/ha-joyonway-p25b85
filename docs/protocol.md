# Protocol

Canonical protocol reference for Joyonway spa RS-485 communication in this repo.
Captured from physical touchpad <-> controller bus sniffing.

This document describes the **current observed protocol** and explicitly marks
where multiple captured command-byte variants exist.

## P25B85

**Controller:** Joyonway P25B85, PCB `P2325B0003 R05`  
**Touchpad:** PB554 colour screen  
**UART:** 38400 baud, 8N1  
**Bus:** RS-485 half-duplex  

### 1. Framing

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Start delimiter | `0x1A` |
| End delimiter | `0x1D` |
| Escape byte | `0x1B` |

**Escape table** — `0x1B XX` on wire → decoded byte:

| Wire pair | Decoded byte |
|-----------|-------------|
| `1B 11` | `0x1A` |
| `1B 0B` | `0x1B` |
| `1B 13` | `0x1C` |
| `1B 14` | `0x1D` |
| `1B 15` | `0x1E` |

**Decoding order:** frame boundaries are detected on raw wire bytes FIRST
(find `0x1A` start, scan for `0x1D` end), then escape decoding is applied
to the content between delimiters.

### 2. CRC-32

All command frames carry a 4-byte CRC. Verified against 44 unique
frames across multiple capture sessions (21 session-1 + 23 phase-6).

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Polynomial | `0x04C11DB7` (standard CRC-32 / Ethernet) |
| Init | `0x00000000` |
| XorOut | `0x552D22C8` |
| Reflected | No (MSB-first) |
| Message input | Unescaped bytes 0–15 (16-byte payload) |
| Preprocessing | Each 32-bit word byte-reversed before CRC |
| CRC position | Bytes 16–19 of unescaped inner frame |
| CRC byte order | Little-endian |

**Algorithm (pseudocode):**

```
function compute_crc(payload[0..15]):
    swapped = word32_swap(payload)   # reverse bytes within each 4-byte group
    crc = 0x00000000
    for each byte b in swapped:
        crc = crc XOR (b << 24)
        repeat 8 times:
            if crc bit 31 is set:
                crc = (crc << 1) XOR 0x04C11DB7
            else:
                crc = crc << 1
            crc = crc AND 0xFFFFFFFF
    return crc XOR 0x552D22C8
```

**Word swap** is due to the PB554's ARM Cortex-M MCU feeding a hardware
CRC peripheral in little-endian word order.

**Wire frame construction:**

```
inner = payload[16 bytes] + crc[4 bytes LE]
escaped = escape(inner)
wire = 0x1A + escaped + 0x1D
```

### 3. Broadcast Frames

The controller sends periodic broadcast frames (~2/sec) reporting spa state.
These are long frames (60+ bytes) prefixed with destination `0xFF`.

**Byte map** (logical frame after unescape, 0-indexed including `0x1A` start):

| Byte | Content |
|------|---------|
| 8 | Model ID (`0x03` = P25B85) |
| 9 | Water temperature (°F, raw integer) |
| 12 | Pump status: `0x00`=off, `0x02`=low, `0x04`=high |
| 13 | Ozone mode flag: bit 7 (`0x80`) = Manual, clear = Auto |
| 14 | Heater/blower flags (see below) |
| 16 | Setpoint temperature (°F) |
| 17 | Light/cycle flags: bit 0 = light ON, bit 7 = heating cycle active |
| 19 | Heat slot 1 start hour + enable flag (hour \| 0x40 if enabled) |
| 21 | Heat slot 1 end hour |
| 23 | Heat slot 2 start hour + enable flag (hour \| 0x40 if enabled) |
| 25 | Heat slot 2 end hour |
| 28 | Activity flags (bit 3=blower, bit 5=activity/disinfection-related) |
| 29 | Filter slot 1 start hour + enable flag (hour \| 0x40 if enabled) |
| 31 | Filter slot 1 end hour |
| 33 | Filter slot 2 start hour + enable flag (hour \| 0x40 if enabled) |
| 35 | Filter slot 2 end hour |
| 53–58 | Date/time: year, month, day, hour, minute, second |

**Byte 14 — heater/blower states:**

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `0x40` | Idle (heater off, blower off) |
| `0x48` | Blower active (base `0x40` + bit 3) |
| `0x50` | Heater enabled/armed — standby (waiting for temp drop) |
| `0x51` | Circulation — pump running pre/post heat (circle icon on panel) |
| `0x54` / `0x55` | Heater actively heating (flame icon on panel) |
| `0x41` / `0xC1` | Disinfection cycle (ozone) |
| `0x58` | Blower + heater standby (base `0x50` + bit 3) |

> **Note on `0x50` ("standby"):** The controller sets byte 14 to `0x50` when
> the heater is enabled (armed). This does NOT indicate the circulation pump is
> physically running — the spa shows `0x50` for hours with 0W consumption,
> only transitioning to `0x55` when it actually heats. Byte 12 (pump) is
> independent and represents manual jets state only, not internal circulation.
> Confirmed via capture analysis: Session 1 baseline shows `0x50` + `pump=0x00`
> for the entire idle period; Phase 5 heater ON/OFF directly toggles between
> `0x40` ↔ `0x50`.
>
> **Heating cycle confirmed (session 17 capture):** Full cycle with byte 17:
> `0x40`+b17=`0x00` (off) → `0x51`+b17=`0x80` (pre-heat circ, ~2 min) →
> `0x55`+b17=`0x80` (heating, ~2 min) → `0x40`+b17=`0x80` (post-heat circ,
> ~2 min, circle icon) → `0x40`+b17=`0x00` (off). Byte 17 bit 7 (`0x80`)
> is the **heating cycle active** flag — set for the entire cycle including
> post-heat circulation. Byte 28 bit 5 (`0x20`) also tracks cycle state
> with identical transitions.

**Byte 14 bit fields:**
- Bit 0: disinfection active (`0x01`)
- Bit 3: blower active (`0x08`)
- Bit 4: circulation/heating base (`0x10`)
- Bit 6: base idle (`0x40`)
- Bit 7: disinfection variant flag (`0x80`, seen in `0xC1`)

For disinfection state, byte 14 (`0x41`/`0xC1`) is the authoritative indicator.
Byte 28 bit 5 is useful activity context but not UV-specific on its own.

### 4. Command Frames

All commands are 22 bytes on wire (may be 23 if CRC contains an escaped
byte). Unescaped inner frame is always 20 bytes: 16 payload + 4 CRC.

**Command type** is determined by byte 4 of the unescaped inner frame:

| Byte 4 | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `0xA1` | Button press | Light, pump, heater, blower, temperature |
| `0xA2` | DateTime set | Set the spa's internal clock |
| `0xA3` | Heat schedule | Program heating time windows |
| `0xA4` | Filter schedule | Program filtration time windows |

**Common header** (bytes 0–6, same across all command types):

```
01 20 10 3C [type] 10 A1
```

Where `[type]` = `A1` / `A2` / `A3` / `A4`.

### 4.1. Button Commands (type 0xA1)

**Payload layout** (16 bytes, 0-indexed):

| Bytes | Content |
|-------|---------|
| 0–6 | Header: `01 20 10 3C A1 10 A1` |
| 7 | Pump command byte 1 (transition encoding) |
| 8 | Pump command byte 2 (transition encoding) |
| 9 | Button group identifier |
| 10 | Button action / value |
| 11 | Modifier byte (usually `0x00`; `0x80` for ozone mode) |
| 12 | Context byte (usually `0xC0`; `0x40` for ozone manual mode) |
| 13 | Always `0x00` |
| 14 | Current setpoint (°F) at time of command |
| 15 | Always `0x00` |

**Button group byte (byte 9) and action byte (byte 10):**

| Button | byte[9] | byte[10] ON | byte[10] OFF | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Light | `0x40` | `0x40` | same (toggle) | Same frame for ON/OFF |
| Heater | `0x08` | `0x18` / `0x08` | `0x11` / `0x00` | Two session variants observed |
| Blower | `0x04` | `0x0C` | `0x00` | Distinct ON/OFF (**live confirmed**) |
| Temperature | `0x80` | `0x98` | — | **Live confirmed**; `0x80` does NOT work |
| Ozone manual | `0x01` | `0x01` | `0x10` | Distinct ON/OFF; ozone mode must be Manual |

**Ozone mode commands** (byte[9]=`0x00`, byte[11]=`0x80`):

| Mode | byte[12] | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Auto | `0xC0` | Standard scheduling mode |
| Manual | `0x40` | Enables manual ON/OFF from panel/RS485 |

These use the pattern: `pump_b9=0x00, btn=0x00, modifier=0x80` with byte[12]
distinguishing the mode. The mode setting is reflected in the broadcast frame
at byte 13 bit 7 (`0x80` = Manual, clear = Auto).

**Pump commands** use bytes 7–8 (panel usually emits transition patterns):

| Transition | byte[7] | byte[8] | byte[9] | byte[10] |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| OFF → Low | `0x02` | `0x02` | `0x00` | `0x00` |
| Low → High | `0x06` | `0x04` | `0x00` | `0x00` |
| High → OFF | `0x04` | `0x00` | `0x00` | `0x00` |

> **Note on legacy pump commands:** Earlier sessions captured byte[10]=`0x08`
> for pump transitions. Phase 6 captures show `0x00`. Both appear to work.
> The controller likely ignores byte[10] for pump commands.

**Controller-accepted jets target bytes (integration canonical behavior):**

| Target | byte[7] | byte[8] | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| Off | `0x04` | `0x00` | Accepted regardless of prior state |
| Low | `0x02` | `0x02` | Accepted regardless of prior state |
| High | `0x06` | `0x04` | Accepted regardless of prior state |

Live tests in this repo confirm direct target writes are accepted (not only
panel-style cycle transitions). The panel UI still behaves as a cycle button.

### 4.2. DateTime Set (type 0xA2)

Sets the spa's internal clock.

**Payload layout:**

| Bytes | Content |
|-------|---------|
| 0–6 | Header: `01 20 10 3C A2 10 A1` |
| 7 | Prefix byte (see below) |
| 8 | Year (offset from 2000, e.g. `0x1A` = 26 = 2026) |
| 9 | Month |
| 10 | Day |
| 11 | Hour (24h) |
| 12 | Minute |
| 13 | Second |
| 14 | `0x00` |
| 15 | `0x00` |

**Prefix byte (byte 7) — controls what is written:**

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `0x05` | Write **date + time** (Y/M/D + H:M:S) |
| `0x50` | Write **time only** (H:M:S; date unchanged) |

Captured from PB554 panel (date change sessions):
- `05 19 04 1A 17 0A 00 00 00` → set 2025-04-26 23:10:00 (date+time) ✅
- `05 18 03 19 16 0B 00 00 00` → set 2024-03-25 22:11:00 (date+time) ✅
- `50 19 04 1A 16 0B 00 00 00` → set time 22:11:00 only (date unchanged) ✅

Previously captured (time-only writes):
- `50 1A 05 15 16 35 00 00 00` → 2026-05-21 22:53:00 (time only)
- `50 1A 05 15 0F 09 00 00 00` → 2026-05-21 15:09:00 (time only)

### 4.3. Heat Schedule (type 0xA3)

Programs heating time windows.

**Payload layout:**

| Bytes | Content |
|-------|---------|
| 0–6 | Header: `01 20 10 3C A3 10 A1` |
| 7 | Enable flags byte (see below) |
| 8 | Slot 1 start hour |
| 9 | Slot 1 start minute |
| 10 | Slot 1 end hour |
| 11 | Slot 1 end minute |
| 12 | Slot 2 start hour |
| 13 | Slot 2 start minute |
| 14 | Slot 2 end hour |
| 15 | Slot 2 end minute |

**Flags byte (byte 7) — state encoding (enable/disable intent):**

| Value | Slot 1 | Slot 2 | Binary |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| `0xAA` | ✅ Enabled | ✅ Enabled | `10101010` |
| `0x62` | ✅ Enabled | ❌ Disabled | `01100010` |
| `0x9A` | ❌ Disabled | ✅ Enabled | `10011010` |
| `0x52` | ❌ Disabled | ❌ Disabled | `01010010` |

The encoding uses 2-bit pairs per slot (not single-bit flags). The same values
apply to both heat and filter schedules — the command type byte (`0xA3` vs
`0xA4`) distinguishes them.

> **Verified (Phase 6):** Three of the four values captured live (`0xAA`,
> `0x62`, `0x9A`). The fourth (`0x52`) is derived by XOR consistency and
> verified by CRC match. `test_build_schedule_command_phase6_match` confirms
> byte-for-byte frame identity against captured wire data.

**Slot 2 write quirk — time-write flags:**

For schedule **time edits**, the controller may ignore slot 2 time values when
slot 2 is disabled unless a force-write variant is used. PB554 panel captures
show distinct flags for time-write intent versus pure enable-state intent.

The PB554 panel works around this by sending a different flags byte when the
user edits times on disabled slots. Captures from 2026-05-31 confirm:

| Scenario on panel | Flags byte | Meaning |
|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| Only slot 1 time edited (both disabled) | `0x52` | Normal both-off |
| Only slot 2 time edited (both disabled) | `0x58` | Force-write slot 2 times |
| Both slot 1 AND slot 2 times edited (both disabled) | `0x5A` | Force-write both slots |
| Slot 1 enabled, slot 2 disabled, edit slot 2 time | `0x6A` | Force-write slot 2 while s1 remains enabled |

Binary analysis:
- `0x52` = `01010010` — base "both disabled" state flags
- `0x58` = `01011000` — slot2-write variant (both disabled)
- `0x5A` = `01011010` — force-write both (both disabled)
- `0x6A` = `01101010` — slot2-write variant when s1=on/s2=off

**Implementation (confirmed):** treat schedule commands with two intent modes:

1. **State mode** (slot enable/disable commands):
   - `(on, on)=0xAA`, `(on, off)=0x62`, `(off, on)=0x9A`, `(off, off)=0x52`
2. **Time-write mode** (schedule time edits):
   - `(on, on)=0xAA`, `(on, off)=0x6A`, `(off, on)=0x9A`, `(off, off)=0x5A`

This mirrors panel behavior and keeps slot2 time writes reliable while disabled.

> **Verified (2026-05-31 captures):** Flags bytes `0x52`, `0x58`, `0x5A`, and
> `0x6A` captured live from PB554 panel across heat/filter scenarios.
> Each capture contains exactly 1 schedule command per change, confirming the
> panel sends a single frame regardless of how many slots are edited.
>
> **Verified (2026-05-31 write tests):** `0x5A` confirmed working for all
> cases: changing only slot 1 (slot 2 unchanged), changing only slot 2
> (slot 1 unchanged), and changing both slots simultaneously. 8/8 automated
> tests passed with user panel confirmation. Safe to use universally.

### 4.4. Filter Schedule (type 0xA4)

Programs filtration time windows.

**Payload layout:** Same as heat schedule (section 4.3) but with type `0xA4`.

**Flags byte (byte 7) — slot enable encoding:**

Same lookup table as heat schedule (section 4.3): `0xAA` = both on,
`0x62` = s1 on / s2 off, `0x9A` = s1 off / s2 on, `0x52` = both off.

> **Verified (Phase 6):** Filter slot enable/disable confirmed to use the same
> flags byte encoding as heat schedules.

### 5. Captured Frame Examples

All frames below are complete wire-level hex (including `0x1A` start and
`0x1D` end delimiters). Escape sequences are present where needed. CRC has
been verified for all frames.

#### 5.3. Button Commands (earlier sessions — pre-Phase 6)

These were captured in earlier sessions. CRC verified. Byte[10] values differ
from Phase 6 for some commands (session-dependent), but all are accepted by
the controller.

| Action | Wire hex |
|--------|----------|
| Light toggle | `1a0120103ca110a10000404000c00056003031eeb21d` |

| Heat schedule | `1a0120103ca310a1620e001000140016004d48aa7f1d` |

#### 5.4. Same-session button bytes comparison

| Action | Session 1 byte[10] | Phase 6 byte[10] | Notes |
|--------|--------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Light toggle | `0x58` | `0x40` | Both toggle, both work |
| Heater ON | `0x08` | `0x18` | Distinct variant |
| Heater OFF | `0x00` | `0x11` | Distinct variant |
| Blower ON | `0x04` | `0x04` | Same |
| Blower OFF | `0x00` | `0x00` | Same |
| Pump transitions | `0x08` | `0x00` | Controller likely ignores |

### 6. Temperature Command Byte Encoding

Temperature commands (type `0xA1`, byte[9]=`0x80`) encode the **target**
setpoint in byte 14 as the Fahrenheit value directly.

**Byte 10:** Use `0x98` — **confirmed working via live test**. `0x80` was
tested and does NOT work. Other variants (`0x99`) were observed in older
captures but `0x98` is the reliable value used by the integration.

**Example:** to set thermostat to 95°F (35°C), build payload:

```
01 20 10 3C A1 10 A1 00 00 80 [variant] 00 C0 00 5F 00
```

Then call `compute_crc(payload)` and `build_frame(payload)`.


### 6b. Schedule Broadcast Encoding

The controller broadcasts schedule state in bytes 19–35 of the broadcast frame.
Each schedule has 2 time slots, encoded as 4 bytes per slot pair:

```
[slot1_start] 00 [slot1_end] 00 [slot2_start] 00 [slot2_end]
```

**Enable flag:** The start byte of each slot uses bit 6 (0x40) as a slot-enabled
flag. The actual hour is in the lower 6 bits (mask 0x3F).

| Raw byte | Enabled? | Hour |
|----------|----------|------|
| `0x4B` | Yes (bit 6 set) | 0x0B = 11 |
| `0x14` | No (bit 6 clear) | 0x14 = 20 |
| `0x51` | Yes (bit 6 set) | 0x11 = 17 |

**Byte positions:**

| Bytes | Schedule |
|-------|----------|
| 19, 21, 23, 25 | Heat: slot1 start, slot1 end, slot2 start, slot2 end |
| 29, 31, 33, 35 | Filter: slot1 start, slot1 end, slot2 start, slot2 end |

**Example** (live capture):
- Byte 19 = `0x4B` → heat slot 1: start=11:00, enabled
- Byte 21 = `0x10` → heat slot 1: end=16:00
- Byte 23 = `0x14` → heat slot 2: start=20:00, disabled
- Byte 25 = `0x16` → heat slot 2: end=22:00
- Byte 29 = `0x4B` → filter slot 1: start=11:00, enabled
- Byte 31 = `0x0C` → filter slot 1: end=12:00
- Byte 33 = `0x51` → filter slot 2: start=17:00, enabled

### 7. Notes

- **Light is a toggle** — same frame for ON and OFF. Software must track
  state and refuse to send when state is unknown.
- **Pump panel UI is a cycle** — OFF → Low → High → OFF on the touch panel.
  On RS485, the controller accepts direct target bytes for OFF/Low/High.
  The integration uses these direct target bytes and confirms via broadcast.
- **Heater and blower** have distinct ON/OFF frames — safe to send
  regardless of current state.
- **Ozone / disinfection** can be toggled via RS485 when mode is set to
  Manual. Send the ozone manual ON/OFF command directly. Auto mode is
  schedule-only. Mode (Auto↔Manual) is set separately via the ozone mode
  command. Broadcast byte 14 transitions: `0x40` → `0xC1` (ozone on),
  `0xC1` → `0x40` (ozone off). Mode setting is broadcast at byte 13 bit 7
  (`0x80` = Manual, clear = Auto) — confirmed from phase 6 captures.
- **Setpoint byte (byte 14)** is the CURRENT setpoint at time of capture,
  embedded in every button command. For non-temperature commands, it acts
  as a "current state echo." The controller accepts commands regardless of
  this byte's value matching actual state.
- **Auto-off**: pump high speed auto-stops after 20 minutes (hardware timer).
- **Panel-local settings** confirmed: Auto Lock, Brightness, and Screen Flip
  produce no RS485 command frames and no broadcast state changes. These are
  handled entirely within the PB554 panel.
- **Light mode setting** was not captured in Phase 6 (skipped). Whether
  light color mode is RS485 or panel-local remains unknown.
- **Byte 17 bit 7** (`0x80`): Set during heating and disinfection. Not a
  light flag — appears to be a general "active operation" indicator.
  The actual light state is byte 17 bit 0 only.

### 8. CRC Derivation Notes

This section summarizes how the CRC parameters were derived and why the final
model is trustworthy, without repeating the full brute-force notebook history.

**Evidence set**

- 21 unique same-session command frames were used, covering every known command
  family: temperature, light, pump, heater, blower, datetime, filter schedule,
  and heat schedule.
- Delta/linearity checks behaved exactly like a CRC-family transform, which
  justified polynomial-focused search methods.

**How the polynomial was found**

- Exhaustive search over all 2^32 CRC-32 polynomials produced one valid result:
  `0x04C11DB7`.
- The key discovery was that payload bytes are processed after **32-bit word
  byte-swap**. Before accounting for this transform, GCD/constraint attempts
  failed because byte-position assumptions were wrong.

**Why `xor_out = 0x552D22C8` is expected**

- This is not an anomaly; it is an equivalent CRC parameterization for this
  message shape.
- Because command headers are mostly constant, their contribution is absorbed
  into an effective output constant, represented here explicitly as `xor_out`
  to keep generation deterministic and reproducible.

**Final canonical model (used in this repo)**

- Polynomial: `0x04C11DB7` (non-reflected, MSB-first)
- Init: `0x00000000`
- Preprocessing: word32 byte-swap on payload bytes `0..15`
- CRC storage: little-endian at bytes `16..19`
- Verification: full match on all 21 unique same-session frames
- Phase 6 verification: 23 additional unique frames, 100% match
