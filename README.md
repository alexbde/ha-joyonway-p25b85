## Overview

This integration brings **local monitoring and control** of a **Joyonway P25B85** spa controller into Home Assistant. Communication is purely local via RS485, bridged to your network through an **Elfin EW11** (or similar) WiFi-to-RS485 adapter in TCP server mode. No cloud, no internet required.

The P25B85 controls spas like the **Home Deluxe White Marble** outdoor whirlpool and similar rigid/hardshell hot tubs with a PB554 colour touchpad.

> **Status: Entities and write control implemented** — the P25B85 byte map has
> been validated against local RS485 captures for temperature, setpoint, pump,
> light, heater, blower, and disinfection states. The CRC-32 algorithm has been
> fully cracked and verified (21/21 frames), enabling dynamic frame generation
> for any command.

|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Spa**          | Home Deluxe White Marble (outdoor whirlpool, rigid/hardshell) |
| **Controller**   | Joyonway P25B85, PCB `P2325B0003 R05`                         |
| **Touchpad**     | PB554 colour screen                                           |
| **RS485 Bridge** | Elfin EW11, RS-485 → WiFi, TCP server mode                    |
| **UART**         | 38400 baud, 8N1                                               |

## Features

- **Water temperature** and **setpoint** monitoring (°C)
- **Thermostat control** (10°C to 40°C) with debounced slider writes
- **Jets control** (off/low/high) via fan preset modes
- **Light** on/off via replay toggle command
- **Heater** manual on/off via replay command
- **Blower** on/off via replay command
- **Heater state** — off / circulation / heating / disinfection
- **Bridge connectivity** sensor
- **Diagnostic sensors** for raw protocol bytes (disabled by default)
- Fully local, no cloud, no internet
- English, French, and German UI translations

### What this integration does NOT do

- ❌ No filtration schedule or heating schedule control (planned)
- ❌ No date/time sync (planned)
- ❌ No disinfection cycle manual control (hardware limitation — schedule only)

---

## Safety Philosophy

The P25B85 uses a 4-byte CRC-32 on all command frames. The CRC algorithm has been fully reverse-engineered (standard CRC-32 polynomial `0x04C11DB7` with word-swap preprocessing) and verified against 21 unique captured frames covering all command types.

- ✅ CRC is computed correctly for every command frame
- ✅ All commands are validated against observed state changes from physical captures
- ✅ Write pacing enforces a 1-second cooldown between commands

> **Note:** KDy documented that sending a frame with an invalid CRC can activate the heater unexpectedly. This integration always computes correct CRC values.

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. Open **HACS** in Home Assistant
2. Click ⋮ (top right) → **Custom repositories**
3. Repository URL: `https://github.com/alexbde/ha-joyonway-p25b85`
4. Category: **Integration**
5. Click **Add**, then find **Joyonway P25B85 Spa** and install
6. **Restart Home Assistant**
7. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → "Joyonway P25B85"**

### Manual

1. Copy `custom_components/joyonway_p25b85/` into your HA `config/custom_components/` folder
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Add the integration via the UI

---

## Configuration

After restart, go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add integration** and search for **Joyonway P25B85**.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| IP address | The IP of your RS485 bridge on the local network |
| TCP port | `8899` (default) |

The integration performs a TCP connection test before saving.

> **⚠️ Single-client limitation:** Most RS485 bridges only accept one TCP connection at a time. Stop the phone app or other tools before using HA.
